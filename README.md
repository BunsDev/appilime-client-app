## Description

Productivity app with focus environment and task features like To-Dos List, Expenses tracker, Timer, Weather based on location, BTC and ETH crypto prices and a game. Depending on your mood, you can change the theme and all the app will show a different style and the music playlist will also change accordingly.

## Backlog Functionalities

In the future I would like to add a calculator and connect the Spotify API so the music playlist comes from there and not Youtube.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, axios, React Context, Services, React Router, leaflet, iframe, React Player, React Spinners and React Hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef.
